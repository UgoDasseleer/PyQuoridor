# PyQuoridor
A little game made during my first year of learning cyber security | My first project 

The code is far away to be clean but as a first project it does his job ^^

# How to play
Just run main.py
```
python3 main.py
```

# Rules
The rules are simple, you can play against an AI or against another player.

You have to go to the other side of the board. You can block the enemy's progression by adding walls.

The first in the other side wins.
